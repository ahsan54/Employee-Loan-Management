# Employee-Loan-Management
This Odoo module streamlines the management of employee loans, from application and approval to installment tracking and accounting integration. It automates the creation and updating of journal entries, including profit journal entries (JV) linked to loan installments. The module ensures that when subsequent installments are paid, the related profit JV is updated rather than creating new ones. It provides features for configuring loan types, reflecting these configurations in the loan application form, and preventing employees from applying for a new loan if they already have an active loan. Additionally, it integrates loan information into the employee form, with smart buttons for accessing the related journal entries and profit JVs. The loan details, including applied amount, interest rate, and outstanding balance, are displayed on the employee’s profile, providing full visibility and control for HR and Finance teams.
